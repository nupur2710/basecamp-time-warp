# To Run the angular Application(client)
1. cd http-start
2. npm install
3. ng serve // everyone doesn't have angular installed on global. better to have an npm start script which does this from your local modules

# To Run the node server (server)
1. cd server
2. npm install
3. npm start // better yet, have a single npm start which will start both the server and client concurrently - look at npm package concurrently
